# Special thanks to the helpful people over at #python on Freenode and Twitter for their help.
# Testing and puzzle solving help credit goes to: @toholdaquill

# Kit Hunter Development:
# Steve Ragan (@SteveD3)
#
# Version 1.0.0
# 26 November 2020
#
#Testing and development took place on the following:
# Python 3.7.3 (Linux)
# Python 2.7.16 (Linux)
# Python 2.7.14 (Linux, Mac)
# Python 2.7.15 (Windows)
#
# Note:
# This version of the script is working with Python 3.
# However, testing is still ongoing.
# See the testing and development section for confirmed versions.
# You should run this script in Python 3 as default.

# Now we're going to sort TMP_kit_hunter_log into blocks and make it easier to read and follow.
# The goal here is to group files and directories, so you get a block for multiple hits and not a wall of text.
#
# You will get a block on each tag detected. This is intentional.
#
# The report is basic:
# 1. The opening line points the administrator to the directory where detection took place.
# 2. After that, the log reports the exact file name that caused the detection.
# 3. Line three shows the tag responsible for the warning in the first place.
# 4. Finally, the log displays the complete line of code where the tag is visible.
#
# During testing, the script generated false positives using the 'unescape' tag, so it was removed...
# ...but adding such a tag will generate several useful hits when obfuscation is used. It's a trade-off.
#
# Run the script a few times and check the results, tune the tag file as needed.
